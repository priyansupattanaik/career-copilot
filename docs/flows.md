# Product flows

**Canonical:** [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) — *How the project works* and *How each feature works*, plus Mermaid diagrams.

## Confirm gate (central)

```text
Upload/parse → review_required → (optional PATCH) → confirm → confirmed
```

Only **confirmed** resume versions and job descriptions feed ATS, learning (via ATS), interview prep evidence, and job-match evidence.

## Primary journey

1. Sign up / sign in → app JWT  
2. Profile / onboarding (optional fill-from-resume preview → apply)  
3. Upload resume → review sections → confirm  
4. Paste or upload JD → confirm  
5. Run ATS analysis → evidence + optional brief  
6. Optional: learning path, mock interview, job recommendations, resume improvement  
7. Re-upload revised resume and re-confirm to iterate
