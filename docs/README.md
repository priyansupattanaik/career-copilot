# Documentation

**Canonical document:** [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md)

That file is the single source of truth for:

- Product aim and golden rule (no invented career facts)
- Tech stack, models, algorithms, prompts
- Architecture and trust boundaries
- **How everything works** end-to-end and per feature
- Agents and LLM routing
- Data model (Supabase PostgreSQL + Supabase Storage)
- Full API map
- Code map
- Frontend routes and systems
- Configuration, operations, testing
- Mermaid diagrams
- Known contracts and caveats
